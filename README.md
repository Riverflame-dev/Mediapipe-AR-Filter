# Mediapipe-AR-Filter
Through this project, we learned how these Augmented Reality Filters work and how we can design and implement our own filters using modern image processing frameworks such as OpenCV and MediaPipe in a Python environment.  Our objective is to develop a program that implements morphed, static, and animated camera filters on a detected human face.
